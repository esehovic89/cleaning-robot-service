# cleaning-robot-service

Service will simulate a robot moving in an office space and will be cleaning the places this robot visits. The path of the robot's movement is
described by the starting coordinates and move commands. After the cleaning has been done, the robot reports the number of unique places cleaned.
The service will store the results into the database and return the created record in JSON format.
